NOTES:
There's a clean file in all the directories,
in order to remove the great quantity of files
produced by the algorithms. However, it is possible
to avoid the removal of the file by typing a "#"
in front of "source clean.sh", placed in the first
rows of the code.

Everytime, a log is produced, containing the
informations generated by conlleval.pl.
The format is the following:
result.(scriptname)-(ngramorder)-(smoothing)
